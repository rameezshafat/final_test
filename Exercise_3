    How many  days, months and years will sandeep take?
'''

# Inputs
total_distance_km = 10000  # total distance to be covered
avg_speed_kmph = 15        # average speed in km/h
hours_per_day = 6          # hours Sandeep cycles per day

# Total time in hours and days
total_hours = total_distance_km / avg_speed_kmph
total_days = total_hours / hours_per_day

# Break down time
years = int(total_days // 365)
remaining_days = total_days - (years * 365)

months = int(remaining_days // 30)
remaining_days -= months * 30

days = int(remaining_days)
remaining_fraction = remaining_days - days

hours = int(remaining_fraction * 24)
minutes = int((remaining_fraction * 24 - hours) * 60)

# Output
print(f"Time required: {years} years, {months} months, {days} days, {hours} hours, {minutes} minutes")
